# The-Economics-Behind-Happiness
A Quantitative Exploration of What Makes Us Happy

I wanted to explore the age old question “How to be happy?” and "Does money buy happiness?" by using my background in Economics and RStudio to analyze quantitative data from Kaggle. Using "World Happiness Report 2021" created by Ajaypal Singh, I was able to predict happiness levels based on freedom to make life decisions, and generosity based on happiness levels. Finally, I analyzed each of the seven factors to determine which of them predicted happiness levels the best.
